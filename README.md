# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

## Overview

This challenge involves refactoring an existing website to make it more accessible. Accessibility is crucial to ensure that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as screen readers and braille keyboards. Additionally, an accessible website can improve search engine rankings and reduce the risk of legal issues related to accessibility.

## User Story

**AS A** marketing agency  
**I WANT** a codebase that follows accessibility standards  
**SO THAT** our own site is optimized for search engines  

## Acceptance Criteria

To meet the project's scope, the following criteria must be satisfied:

1. **GIVEN** a webpage meets accessibility standards  
   **WHEN** I view the source code  
   **THEN** I find semantic HTML elements

2. **WHEN** I view the structure of the HTML elements  
   **THEN** I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

3. **WHEN** I view the image elements  
   **THEN** I find accessible `alt` attributes

4. **WHEN** I view the heading attributes  
   **THEN** they fall in sequential order

5. **WHEN** I view the title element  
   **THEN** I find a concise, descriptive title




The layout is designed for "desktop," so some elements may appear differently on smaller screens.

Submit the completed Challenge for review by the instructional staff. Ensure that all acceptance criteria are met and that the codebase follows accessibility standards.
